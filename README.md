### Project Description

A smart hospital queue management system that calculates patient waiting time and automatically alerts patients using audio notification when their waiting time is over. The system helps reduce confusion and improves patient flow inside hospitals.

### The Problem Statement

In hospitals, patients often wait without knowing their exact turn time. This leads to overcrowding, missed turns, and inefficient queue management.

### The Solution

Our system manages patient queues digitally, calculates waiting time dynamically, and plays an audio alert when a patient’s waiting time ends, ensuring smooth and organized hospital operations.
